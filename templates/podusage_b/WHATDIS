These are copies of a more elaborate attempt at using
Pod::Usage with Getopt::Std for standard script templates:

*Waaay* too much cruft.  I delete two-thirds of this shit
every time I create a script.  Any the usage you get out
of Pod::Usage is fugly as hell, not at all what you want:
fuck it.

(Sometimes, the old, traditional ways that every one hates
really *deserve* the hate.)
