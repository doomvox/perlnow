/home/doom/End/Cave/Perlnow/lib/perlnow/templates/dev/WHATDIS

This is a collection of perlnow templates under development.

"dev" takes precedence if there's a file, otherwise "standard" files are used:

PUSHOUT PROCEEDURE (for *local* use):
cp -f ~/End/Cave/Perlnow/lib/perlnow/templates/standard/*.tpl ~/.templates
cp -f ~/End/Cave/Perlnow/lib/perlnow/templates/dev/*.tpl      ~/.templates


As of April 2017, rm-ing all of the files here: "standard" is being
updated for the third big release.
