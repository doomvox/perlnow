This directory contains some alternate template files that you may
choose to use instead of the perlnow defaults:

TEMPLATE.perlnow-object-pm.tpl
    a template for Class::Std-based classes.  For an explanation of why
    you would want to write classes this way, see the Class::Std documentation
    on CPAN, or read Damian Conway's book _Perl Best Practices_.
    This code meticulously follows Damian's conventions.

    In addition, this code uses Log::Log4perl, though this contradicts
    Damian, who prefers Log::Stdlog.

TEMPLATE.perlnow-pm.tpl
    a template for Perl modules that are not classes.  This differs
    from the default only in that it uses Perl6::Export::Attrs,
    a terser and easier-to-learn alternative to Exporter.
    ("Perl6" means simply that it mimics, in Perl 5, syntax that will
    be built into Perl 6.  So you can use it now; you don't have to
    wait for Perl 6.
