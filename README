perlnow.el is a collection of utility commands for perl programmers
who use emacs. These commands are designed to help automate some
routine tasks in (1) the initial creation of perl scripts and
modules (2) running, testing and debugging inside of emacs.

DOCUMENTATION

Detailed documentation has been included inside the code itself,
and can be accessed using the emacs help system:

   ESC x help v perlnow-documentation-tutorial

Think of it as the poor man's pod (or perhaps the lazy man's info).

INSTALLATION

Put the perlnow.el file somewhere that's included in your load-path.

Also install Christoph Wedler's template.el because many features
of this package depend on it.  The latest version of template.el
can be found at:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47369

You'll fine a set of template files ("*.tpl") you can use here:

  http://github.com/doomvox/perlnow/tree/master/templates/standard/
        
To start with, copy those templates to your templates directory, 
which by default is ~/.templates. 

In your ~/.emacs file, add something like the following:

   (require 'template)
   (template-initialize)
   (require 'perlnow)

   (perlnow-define-standard-keymappings)

Alternately, if you'd like a different prefix than the
default "C-c\", you can supply it as an argument:

   (perlnow-define-standard-keymappings "C-c'")

You might also like to set some customization variables 
like so:

  (setq perlnow-script-location
      (substitute-in-file-name "$HOME/bin"))
  (setq perlnow-pm-location
      (substitute-in-file-name "$HOME/lib"))
  (setq perlnow-dev-location
      (substitute-in-file-name "$HOME/dev"))

Additional documentation can be found in the docstrings of 
dummy variables named perlnow-documentation-*, e.g. 

   ESC x help v perlnow-documentation-installation
