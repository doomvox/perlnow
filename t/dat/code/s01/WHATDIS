The 01-perlnow-misc.t tests are primary for a bunch of little 
utilities that need know trees of file on disk to operate on.
The existing informal trial-run code works on some of the
files used for other tests, so I've just arbitrarily copied all
of them into the tree for these tests, to see if things will work
with minimal modification.
