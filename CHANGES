Bug fixes with script creation from different contexts (e.g. man page,
woman page, etc).  Pushing out as version 0.43.

Added a user feature to display the current default @INC in an emacs buffer:

   perlnow-display-inc-array

Examining @INC in a readable format is something I often want, so why not?

 o  Added features that use module-starter to create Module::Build
    based projects.

 o  Defined additional template expansions:

    (>>>FULL_DATE<<<)        August 23, 2009
    (>>>AMERICAN_DATE<<<)    8/23/09

 o  Re-wrote perlnow-get-inc-spot-classic: fixes the generation of relative
    paths between a script and a module it uses.

Smaller changes:

 o  perlnow-check now turns on strict as well as warnings during the
    check phase.

 o  Added feature to silently ignore redundant ".pm" extensions fed
    to perlnow-module. Entering "/tmp/dev/Module::Stuff.pm" to
    longer creates "/tmp/dev/Module/Stuff.pm.pm".

 o  Fixed bug with perlnow-h2xs, which would crash when trying to
    find a string in the generated test file which no longer exists:
    now just moves point to bottom of test file.

The function perlnow-define-standard-keymappings now allows
you to override the "C-c/" prefix with a different choice, for
example:

  (perlnow-define-standard-keymappings "\C-'")

Modified perlnow-perlversion-old-to-new to pass
through newer style versions such as "5.8.0" unchanged.

===
Sat Sep  5 15:04:15 2009

Removed dependancy of perlnow-edit-test-file on the marker
(>>>9<<<) in the test file template: now it searches for the "use"
(or "use_ok") line for the module, via the new perlnow-jump-to-use
function.

Fixed bug in perlnow-get-package-name-from-man
that could yeild false positives on scripts, leading
to perlnow-script from a script context having
a very bad, misleading runstring refering to the context
script instead of the new one.

Version 0.45 is essentially a bugfix release:

 o  Fixed generated runstrings when using "prove".

 o  With Module::Build::Tiny you need not have a MANIFEST
    file, and this confused the old algorithm that identified
    a cpan-style project, and this in turn could break
    finding the "t" directory from a *.pm file.  This is fixed.

 o  Changed test policy defaults:

    perlnow-test-path                   was: "." "../t" "./t",  now: "../t" "./t"
    perlnow-test-policy-test-location   was: "./t",             now: "../t"
    perlnow-test-policy-dot-definition  was: "fileloc",         now: "incspot"

    My ideas about good locations to place test files (and my
    experience about where they're likely to be found) has changed
    over the years.

 o  Fixed bug where perlnow-run could get confused by a blank
    setting of existing-run-string

 o  New customization variable: perlnow-force.  When this is
    non-nil, perlnow will avoid asking questions about issues
    like directory creation and so on.  (This is useful for
    writing tests, at the very least.)

 o  When multiple applicable test files are available, the guess
    that perlnow makes as to which one you're most likely to
    be interested in now favors a recent manual selection
    (experimental).

 o  Created a new command, perlnow-run-perltidy, which works on
    the entire buffer by default (operating on the region alone
    can confuse perltidy, because it can't know anything about
    surrounding context).   The perltidy commands have some
    added safety features, checking to make sure the perltidy
    script can be found, and avoiding use on non-perl buffers.

  o Removed all code for deprecated "alt" run strings, and
    moved to a new package perlnow-deprecated.el.

Plus many other miscellanious small fixes.

I apologize for the continual minor drift in the UI with each release.
In the near future I hope to stabilize things to avoid this going
forward.

Version 0.8

With this release, I'm stripping out the now obsolete test-policy features.
